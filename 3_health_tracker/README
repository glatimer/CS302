You should be able to compile this program using make.
A safe bet is to "make clean" from the command line to 
compile from scratch.

This program will have a hierarchy of health_event derived classes:
1) fitness
2) supplements
3) intermittent fasting (IF)

The program will record various health events and add them to a BST
ordered by the event's title.  

The client will select from an option menu:
1) add a health event
2) display the tree of health events
3) edit a health event
4) complete a task
5) remove a health event from the tree
6) remove all events from the tree

I attempted to use upcasting to access the IF class's alert() 
function, but it was not successful.  You can test this by 
selecting [4] complete a task from the menu and enter Week 1.  
Nothing will happen for the IF complete a task like it should.
However, [4] complete a task will work as expected for the other
classes in the hierarchy -- fitness and supplements.
